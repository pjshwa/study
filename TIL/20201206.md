- Are we *really* engineers? by Hillel Wayne (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3018ABlET1Y)
  - Common myth: Traditional Engineering vs Software Engineering
    - Stable Tech vs Always Changing
      - Mostly true, but probably because Software Engineering has a short history
      - Most engineerings were not stable in the first place. For example, in 1800s, bridges were very faulty (1/4 of them would collapse for various reasons)
    - Restrictive vs Creative
      - Trad Engineering also applies numerous hacks to solve the shortcomings of what is already given
  - What's different in Software Engineering?
    - Consistency
      - You would EXPECT a same result from running a same bit of python code, even if you run it on different machines.
      - Case is not true in anything engineering which depends on physical matter: e.g. resistors. Resistors' specs themselves are defined like this: "10 mil ohms, with variability of 10% (9.5 mil ~ 10.5 mil)"
    - Velocity
      - Much much faster than any other engineering fields
      - Iteration is much faster: developing a culture with unique characteristics
    - Constraints
      - Not hardly enforced as other engineering fields.
  - What can we learn from each other?
    - What we can learn
      - Responsibility, Physicality
        - Software people tend to be alienated from customers, because they don't have opportunity to get a physical hold of what they are making
      - Requirements
        - Spend some time figuring out what the customers actually need
    - What we can give
      - VERSION CONTROL
        - "Bisecting as a debugging technique": at what particular point of time did something go wrong?
      - Open conferences, open source
